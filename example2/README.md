# Issue Summary

CrossHair Tool - Python

As a tool user I want to be able to identify test cases with particular assertions broken.

Current implementation
Having a function under test that looks like this

```python
def named_assertion_error(a: int):
    assert a > 100, "This is assertion error that should appear in test case match - first checkpoint"
    assert a > 160, "This is assertion error that should appear in test case match - second checkpoint"
```

We get these test cases generated by cover command:

```python
import pytest
from main import named_assertion_error


def test_named_assertion_error():
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError):
        named_assertion_error(101)


def test_named_assertion_error_2():
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError):
        named_assertion_error(0)


def test_named_assertion_error_3():
    assert named_assertion_error(161) == None
```

But it would be nice if crosshair tool could also recognize that there is an exception argument at least from assertion
exception
and add it to test cases _match_ directive of **pytest.raises** call like below:

```python
from main import named_assertion_error
import pytest


def test_named_assertion_error():
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError,
                       match='This is assertion error that should appear in test case match - second checkpoint'):
        named_assertion_error(101)


def test_named_assertion_error_2():
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError,
                       match='This is assertion error that should appear in test case match - first checkpoint'):
        named_assertion_error(0)


def test_named_assertion_error_3():
    assert named_assertion_error(161) == None
```

Example patch that could be applied is in this repository under [pytest_raises_change.diff](pytest_raises_change.diff),
applicable to crosshair tool v0.0.42
